## Overview

Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br/>
There are 6 ally characters - Pekeji, Oryu, Mamo, Doll, Nfuu, and Borg Mamel.<br/>
Some characters have a unique ability, and they can all grow stronger through leveling up.

Those looking for a more classic roguelike experience can play without allies.

### Ally Stats

Maximum level varies by character, and level ups don't persist between adventures except for Doll and Borg Mamel.

Experience points are distributed to all party members regardless of who defeated the monster.<br/>The amount of experience points doesn't change based on number of party members.

Unlike Shiren 5, this game doesn't have a way to display ally HP.<br/>
You can talk to them to get a rough idea, but keep in mind that talking is a turn ending action.<br/>

Herb and Otogiriso will restore HP when thrown at an ally.<br/>
Max HP won't increase when they're at full HP.
