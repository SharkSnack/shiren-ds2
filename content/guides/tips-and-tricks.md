## Basics

- Weapons and shields have an upgrade limit, and can't be upgraded any further once that limit is reached.
- Weapons, shields, and bracelets have a limited number of rune slots, and no more runes can be added once full.
- Sorting your inventory when you have multiple stacks of 99 arrows will reduce it to a single 99 arrow stack.
- A cracked bracelet can be repaired by reading a Plating Scroll or by inserting it into a Blessing Pot.
- Most staves will produce the same effect as a magic bullet when thrown, even with a remaining use count of 0.
    - Thrown staves are effective against Ether Devil types.
- Hold B to step on Gitan without picking it up - You can then throw, swap, or insert the Gitan into a pot.
    - Thrown Gitan deals damage equal to 10% of its value, or 100% of its value if blessed.
- Winds of Kron blows when 700 turns have elapsed on a floor, and you get sent back to Town of Ilpa at 1000 turns.
    - You lose all items and Gitan if you get sent back, and you can't request a rescue.
- Eating an Herb or Otogiriso when your HP is full increases max HP.
    - Herb - Max HP +1
    - Otogiriso - Max HP +2
- Eating an Onigiri or Large Onigiri when you're full increases max fullness.
    - Onigiri - Max fullness +1
    - Large Onigiri - Max fullness +2
- When you have multiple onigiri on hand, it's best to eat smaller onigiri first to free up inventory space.
- Direct attacks can be used to check for hidden traps 1 tile ahead.
    - The range to check for traps remains 1 tile ahead even with Aura Spear or Razor Wind.
- Strip Trap can be used to remove a cursed weapon, shield, or bracelet.
- You can use <span class="blueText">Shoot</span>, <span class="blueText">Throw</span>, and <span class="blueText">Swing</span> commands like normal while afflicted with Confused status.
- You'll collapse if you step on a Spoil Trap or get hit by explosion damage while afflicted with Onigiri status.
- Thrown items pierce through walls and creatures when you have a Pierce Bracelet equipped.
- If Cell Armor disarms your weapon or shield while a Pierce Bracelet is equipped, the item is permanently lost.
- Extinction Scroll makes <span class="danger">the specific monster level</span> hit by the scroll vanish for the duration of the adventure.
    - Example: Throw Extinction Scroll at Archdragon → Dragon, Sky Dragon, and Abyss Dragon can still appear.
- Colors used for item names mean specific things.
    - White - Identified.
    - Yellow - Unidentified.
    - Red - Cursed.
    - Green - Synthesized item, or an item with an assigned a name.

    - The monster will warp to a random room on the current floor.
- Muzzled status can be cured by using a non-meat item to transform into a monster.
    - Abosrb Pot - Use the pot.
    - Presto Staff - Swing at a Taishodon or Phantom Devil, or have a monster throw it at Shiren.
- Demon Warrior and Dark Slasher overlap on 12-14F for most dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.
    - Use Ghost Warrior to level up Dark Slasher, then use arrows to safely defeat it to level up.
    - Dark Slasher (52 exp), Sneaky Slasher (210 exp), Shadow Slasher (1800 exp), Wild Slasher (2300 exp)
- You can position Mamo between a Bow Boy type monster and Shiren to easily collect arrows.
- If you have a Dodge Shield (避) or Reflect Shield (返), you can step on arrow traps to collect arrows.

## Blessing / Curse

Items can be blessed or cursed in this game, and the effect varies depending on the item category.<br/>Blessings enhance an item's effect, and curses either make the item unusable, or unable to be unequipped.

#### Blessing

Throw an item at Blessing Plant monster or insert items into a Blessing Pot to bless items.<br/>For some item categories, the blessing can be lost when certain actions occur.

|Category|Effect|Loss Condition|
|-|-|-|
|Weapon|Direct attacks deal more damage.|Use a direct attack (chance)|
|Shield|Receive less damage.|Get hit by an attack (chance)|
|Bracelet|Bracelet won't crack from damage.|Get hit by an attack (chance)|

|Pot|None.|None|
|Meat|Transformation duration is doubled.|None|
|Trap|Can't gain blessed status.|None|
|Gitan|Damage dealt is equal to value.|None|

#### Curse

Items gain cursed status from Curse Girl monster special attacks, Curse Trap, or Curse Pot.<br/>Curses can be removed by reading a Purify Scroll, and the 払 (Holy Shield) rune blocks curses.<br/>In some cases, items you find can be cursed from the start.

|Category|Effect|
|-|-|
|Weapon|Can't unequip.|
|Shield|Can't unequip.|
|Bracelet|Can't unequip.|

|Trap|Can't gain cursed status.|
|Gitan|Deals 2 damage when thrown.|

## Falling Items

- Items won't land on traps or other items when they fall to the ground.
- 5x5 tiles from where the item fell is the max distance an item can fall - beyond that, the item is lost.

## Sanctuary Scroll

- Sanctuary Scrolls on the ground are effective even before you pick them up and place them down.
    - Place a Blank Scroll on the ground before writing Sanctuary Scroll to get 2 uses out of it.
- Hannya Warrior's attack reflection is nullified when you're standing on a Sanctuary Scroll.
    - Samuraidon's counter damage is NOT nullified.
- Monsters that step on a Sanctuary Scroll will vanish without granting experience points.
    - Bad Aim Bracelet can be used to one-shot a monster with a thrown Sanctuary Scroll, but it's wasteful.
    - Swap Staff, Knockback Staff, Pull Staff, etc. can be used to force a monster onto the scroll.
- Sanctuary Scrolls cannot be moved by staves once they're stuck to the ground.

## Wily Tanuki

- Wily Tanukis are disguised as items when generated, similar to N'dubba in other games.
    - Disguised Wily Tanukis can be sold in shops.
- They always jump out directly above Shiren's current location when their disguise wears off.
    - Unless there's a wall, character, or Sanctuary Scroll blocking the tile.
    - If the tile above Shiren is a water tile, the Wily Tanuki will warp somewhere else.
    - If the entity limit has been reached, the Wily Tanuki will vanish instead.
- If you throw a disguised Wily Tanuki into water, the monster will sink instead of appearing.
- If you throw a disguised Wily Tanuki at a Pitcher Plant, its disguise will change to a grass item.
    - If you then throw an Extinction Scroll at a different Wily Tanuki, the disguised item will turn real.
- Wily Tanuki are revealed in your inventory when you return to town.

## Upgrade Value

Some common techniques to upgrade equipment for postgame dungeons.<br/>Doing Blacksmith runs also works if you don't have the needed items, but it's slower and costs Gitan.<br/>Use Training Dungeons to obtain items like Absorb Pot and Happy Staff from [Abyssal Depths](/dungeons/abyssal-depths).

##### Storage Note

All 3 of these methods can be done inside the storage in Town of Ilpa.<br/>Bring back a Lv3-4 Pitcher Plant using an Imprison Pot and throw it to make it appear inside the storage.<br/>Corner it using 3 Sanctuary Scrolls for safety, and carry Revival Grass just to be extra safe.

#### Blessing Plant (Lv3)

Use an Absorb Pot with Blessing Plant's power to bless Pot God, Heaven, and Earth scrolls.<br/>※ Blessing Plant - Blesses the item underfoot when you open the Absorb Pot.

1. Use an Absorb Pot on a Blessing Plant until the pot is full.
2. Bless Pot God, Heaven, and Earth scrolls.
3. Read Heaven and Earth scrolls to upgrade equipment until the blessing on the scrolls wears off.
4. Read Pot God Scrolls on the Absorb Pot and return to step 1. 

#### Upgrade Plant (Lv4)

Use an Absorb Pot with Upgrade Plant's power to upgrade an item underfoot.<br/>※ Upgrade Plant - Increases capacity of a pot to 5, or equipment upgrade value by 5.

1. Use an Absorb Pot on an Upgrade Plant until the pot is full.
2. Place a weapon or shield underfoot and open the Absorb Pot to increase upgrade value.
3. Repeat step 2 until the Absorb Pot's capacity is [1].
4. Place the Absorb Pot underfoot and increase its capacity back to [5], and return to step 1.

#### Soul Sickle (セ)

Synthesize セ (Cell Armor Sword) into a Soul Sickle, then knock away thrown items from a Lv3-4 Pitcher Plant.

1. Throw an item you want to bless or upgrade at a Blessing Plant or Upgrade Plant.
2. Use direct attacks with the Soul Sickle (セ) equipped until the item is knocked away from the monster.

## Big Moai Items

Big Moai is located in Town of Ilpa until you receive the 10th reward, after which they go on a journey.<br/>Once they leave Town of Ilpa, they can be randomly found between 1-17F in [Jahannam's Gate](/dungeons/jahannams-gate).<br/><span class="danger">※ These items require a Wi-Fi connection + Shiren 3 (Wii) friend code to obtain - Currently unobtainable.</span><br/><span class="danger">※ Friend Code: 1075-1871-1205 (100484 points) - Listed for historic purposes only.</span>
