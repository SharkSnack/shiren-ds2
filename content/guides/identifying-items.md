## Basics

Identify Scroll can be used to identify 1 item.<br/>However, there's a small chance for all inventory items to be identified if you're lucky,<br/>so it's best to take out unidentified items from Storage Pots before reading Identify Scrolls.<br/>Identify Scrolls should be used on pots since other categories can be identified using Identify Pots.

Even when you don't have the means to fully identify items, you can test items and assign names to them.<br/>Knowing what an unidentified staff does can make or break your run, depending on the situation.

## Equipment

### Weapon / Shield

Weapons and shields always have their real name when generated.<br/>However, upgrade value and cursed/blessed status are unknown until the item is equipped.<br/>Therefore, it's best to wait to equip unidentified weapons and shields until you find a Strip Trap.<br/>Alternatively, you can reference the [Price Chart](/items/price-chart) and check for cursed status based on price.
